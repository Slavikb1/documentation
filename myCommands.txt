ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is an error-reporting protocol that network devices such as routers use to generate error messages to the source IP address when network problems prevent delivery of IP packets.

ip addr show
ifconfig
ping google.com -c 4 (will send 4 packets to test connection)
tracert www.google.com - will trace all the hoops to reach the destination with latency
netstat -antp - will show all the TCP open ports on the curent machine
ps -ef | grep 3675 (based on the open ports to find the process) (netstat -antp | grep 3675)
ss -tunlp 
nmap
dig www.google.com
nslookup www.google.com
route -n - Kernel IP routing table (mostly to see gateways)
arp - maping the ip to MAC address
mtr - live trace
nmap
telnet 192.168.40.12(ip) 22(port)

/etc/profile - global configuration
.bashrc - for the user

read -sp "will prompt and suppres the input: " user

/etc/ssh/sshd_config - hold the variable "passwordAuthentification" (asking on login the password for ssh client(login from different machine))

ssh-keygen - generating private and public key pair

ssh-copy-id devops@web01 (will copy the lock(public key) to the remote machine)

/etc/hostname - hold the records of ip with address (192.168.40.2 slavik.com - like that)

The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com.
